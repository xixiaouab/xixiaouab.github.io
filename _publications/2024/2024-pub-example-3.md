abstract: >-
  Video identity customization seeks to produce high-fidelity videos that maintain consistent identity and exhibit significant dynamics based on users' reference images. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: identity degradation over extended video length and reduced dynamics during training, primarily due to their reliance on traditional self-reconstruction training with static images. To address these issues, we introduce MagicID, a novel framework designed to directly promote the generation of identity-consistent and dynamically rich videos tailored to user preferences.
