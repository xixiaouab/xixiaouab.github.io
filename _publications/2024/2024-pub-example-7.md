  In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning for adapting large-scale vision models within the “pretrain-then-finetune” paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain blurred as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research, reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further organizes them by injection granularity: pixel-level and token-level. Beyond the core methodologies, we examine PA’s integrations across diverse domains, including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA’s methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research. For a comprehensive list of Prompt-based Adaptation method, readers are encouraged to visit the repository at https://github.com/yunbeizhang/Awesome-Visual-Prompt-Tuning.
