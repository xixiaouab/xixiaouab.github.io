  Hi, everyone! I am <strong>Xi Xiao</strong>, a second-year Ph.D. student in the 
  <a href="https://www.uab.edu/cas/computerscience/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> 
  at the 
  <a href="https://www.uab.edu/home/" target="_blank">University of Alabama at Birmingham</a>, 
  co-advised by <a href="https://wangt0716.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Tianyang Wang</a> and 
  <a href="https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/" target="_blank">Dr. Min Xu</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I am currently conducting a research internship at the 
  <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/division/csed" target="_blank">Computational Sciences and Engineering Division</a> 
  of 
  <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/" target="_blank">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, 
  supervised by 
  <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/xiao-wang" target="_blank">Dr. Xiao Wang</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I am broadly interested in designing <strong>efficient and intelligent machine learning systems</strong> that can operate under extreme conditions of computation, data, and storage. 
  Recently, I am working on <strong>Model Quantization</strong> and <strong>Efficient Domain Adaptation</strong> for large language, multimodal, and vision models (<strong>LLMs</strong>, <strong>MLLMs</strong>, and <strong>LVMs</strong>), 
  aiming to make them <strong>performant, scalable, and sustainable</strong> in real-world environments.
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>I'm always open to collaboration and discussion — if you're interested in my research or have any awesome ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me :)</em>
  </p>
